Simple Blockchain Simulation with Tampering Detection

## Overview
This project implements a basic blockchain in Python that supports:
- Adding blocks with transactions.
- SHA-256 hashing to secure data.
- Validation to detect tampering.

## Features
✔ Blockchain with linked blocks  
✔ SHA-256 hashing for security  
✔ **Tampering Detection** – Alerts when data is modified  
✔ Easy-to-read display of blockchain  

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or copy the `blockshort.py` file.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the script using:
   python blockshort.py
